## **Phase 1 – Backend Foundations**

1. **Install dependencies & set up `.env`**

   * You already did: `MONGODB_URI`, `TWELVEDATA_API_KEY`, `NEWS_PROVIDER=yahoo`, `BASE_CURRENCY=USD`.
   * ✅ **Done**

2. **Run the backend server**

   * `npm run dev`
   * Fix any `import`/`module` issues (you did that by adding `"type": "module"` in `package.json`).
   * ✅ **Done** (your server logs “MongoDB connected”)

---

## **Phase 2 – Database Seeding**

3. **Seed Portfolios**

   * Run `npm run seed`
   * Check `GET http://localhost:4000/api/portfolios` — should return 5 portfolios.
   * ✅ **You did this and can see them**

4. **Seed Transactions** (next step)

   * Create a `transactionsSeed.js` with realistic BUY/SELL data (AAPL, NVDA, BTC, etc.).
   * Run `node seeds/transactionsSeed.js` to load them into MongoDB.
   * Test `GET http://localhost:4000/api/portfolios/:id/holdings` — should return positions with qty & cost.
   * ✅ **You did this and can see them**

---

## **Phase 3 – Pricing & Math**

5. **Integrate Price Services**

   * Stocks → Twelve Data batching (`tdQuoteBatch`)
   * Crypto → CoinGecko (`cgSimplePrice`)
   * Cache results (60–90s) to save API credits.

6. **Portfolio Math on Server**

   * For each holding:

     ```
     positionQty = sum(BUY qty) - sum(SELL qty)
     costBasis = sum(qty * price)
     currentValue = positionQty * latestPrice
     PnL = currentValue - costBasis
     ```
   * Add “today’s change” using previous close.
   * ✅ **You did this and can see them**
---

## **Phase 4 – API Endpoints**

7. **Build the following routes**

   ```
   GET /api/portfolios              → list all
   GET /api/portfolios/:id/summary  → KPIs (value, PnL, today change)
   GET /api/portfolios/:id/holdings → holdings table
   GET /api/quotes?symbols=AAPL,BTC → debug quotes
   GET /api/news?symbol=AAPL        → Yahoo/MarketAux
   ```

   * Test with Postman or browser.

---

## **Phase 5 – Frontend Wiring**

8. **Connect Frontend to Backend APIs**

   * Replace hardcoded table data with `/api/portfolios/:id/holdings` response.
   * Replace KPIs with `/api/portfolios/:id/summary` data.
   * Replace news with `/api/news`.

9. **Enable Live Updates**

   * Backend: `/api/sse` route to push updates every 30–60s.
   * Frontend: Listen to SSE and update state.

---

## **Phase 6 – Extra Features**

10. **Performance Chart API**

    * `GET /api/portfolios/:id/performance?period=1M` returns price history.
    * Backend pulls from Twelve Data (stocks) & CoinGecko (crypto).

11. **Dashboard Aggregation**

    * Combine all portfolios into one set of KPIs & chart.

12. **Final Testing**

    * Seed data for multiple portfolios.
    * Check frontend matches backend calculations.
    * Simulate API downtime to confirm caching works.

Alright — I’ll break this whole thing into **clear, numbered steps** so you’ll always know *exactly* where you are and what comes next.
Think of it like a **checklist from zero to working frontend**.
