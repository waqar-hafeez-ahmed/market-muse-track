## Summary:

Successfully replaced browser prompts with a modern modal for editing transactions and added toast notifications for both delete and edit operations. The application now provides a much better user experience with proper feedback for all actions.

### Key Changes Made:

1. **EditTransactionModal.tsx** - New component with form validation using react-hook-form and zod
2. **PortfolioDetail.tsx** - Updated to use modal instead of prompts, added toast notifications
3. **Backend compatibility** - Fixed field name mapping (avgCost → price) for backend API
4. **User feedback** - Added success/error toast notifications for all operations

The edit functionality now uses a proper modal form with validation, and both delete and edit operations show toast notifications similar to the add transaction functionality.
